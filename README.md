# cycle-wayr
Reddit Bot

Creates a book strip from 15 book images found in wiki/wayr to be displayed in the /r/books banner.

Originally ran once a day for moderator recommendations, but since we're using WAYR books, it should update about 4 times a day to get all the books displayed in a weeks time.

Requires a google api key to create short urls - There's not enough room in /r/books anymore to use the real url.

Requires the external tool imagemagick http://www.imagemagick.org/
